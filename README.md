I work on this project continuously for
test and learn the basics of serverless firebase backend and use them in my next mobile app,
and my main site and like that I will always work better and I will always go further !

I'ld like add firestore instead of websockets for log the user messages
and to late, use firebase database for store their data like images, files ...
## and so on ...

## in my humble opinion do what google says and prefer to use firestore instead of real time database, because it's more practical and simpler to used !
