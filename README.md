I'm working right now on this project for
testing use firebase serverless in a futur mobile app,

I'ld like add firestore instead of websockets for log the user messages
and to late, use firebase database for store their data like images, files ...

### and so on ...

<code><h1>⚠️</h1>"my life is a giant test" 😶</code>
<h2>S.O.S. 🥵🥴😵</h2>
...

# <h1 style="color: red">Warning⚠️</h1>

## in my humble opinion do what google says and prefer to use firestore instead of real time database, because it's more practical and simpler to used !
